---

## Objective
In a complex digital marketing landscape, the primary challenge was linking disparate spending data (Market Spent) to the actual revenue generated (Revenue) to determine which channels were consuming budget without delivering profitable returns.

To engineer a dynamic Power BI dashboard aimed at optimizing budget efficiency by precisely identifying all campaigns with negative ROI and strategically refocusing attention towards the highest-yielding, most profitable channels.

## Key Insights & Actionable Findings
The analysis shifted the focus from merely reporting data to driving immediate, high-impact business decisions:
- Identified Budget Leakage: The dashboard pinpointed three specific sub-campaigns (within Facebook and Instagram) that were consistently generating Negative ROI. This finding presents an immediate opportunity to reallocate a substantial budget amount to more effective channels.
- High-Performance Channels: The visualization confirmed that the Social and Search categories are the primary drivers for leads and orders. 
- Spending Pattern vs. Revenue: Daily trend analysis revealed a direct correlation between increased spending during the 15th to 25th of the month and a significant spike in revenue generation.
